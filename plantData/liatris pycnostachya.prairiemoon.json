  "description": "Prairie Blazing Star matures to 4' in wet to medium soil conditions and will do well in poor soils such as clay. It grows best in full sun to partial shade, and blooms in July, August, and September. It makes an excellent cut flower. Like many Liatris species, when it begins to bloom it starts at the top and works its way down. The lower half of the plant is covered in thin, grass-like leaves.  This is an excellent Liatris species to plant in wet-medium prairies and perennial gardens; butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds are attracted to it all summer.  The roots on Liatris spp. are called corms, which can form offshoots from the mother plant over time.   Prairie Blazing Star would grow well next to many other popular natives including  Yellow Coneflower (Ratibida pinnata),  Rattlesnake Master (Eryngium yuccifolium),  Mountain Mint (Pycnanthemum virginianum),  Wild Bergamot (Monarda fistulosa), and Goldenrods. Other common names include Kansas Gayfeather.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
