  "description": "Switch Grass is most attractive in its later stages, from the emerging, purple cloud-like seed heads mid-summer to dried golden foliage in fall. Consider not cutting Switch Grass back late fall in your garden; it holds up well in heavy snow providing winter cover for small mammals and land birds.Birds will also feed on the seeds.  A dominant grass of what was the vast tallgrass North American prairie, it is clump-forming and rhizomatous.  It is an aggressive species, not suited to very small landscapes.  Switch Grass is a warm-season grass; it actively grows during the summer when soil temperatures are warm.\nThis seed is sold as PLS (Pure Live Seed). For example, if you order 1 lb and the PLS is 80%, you receive 1.25 lbs of bulk seed. Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
