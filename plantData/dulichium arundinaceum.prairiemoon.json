  "description": "This unique sedge is easily identified by its alternate 3-ranked leaves up the stem. This means when you view the plant from the top all the leaves will be lined up neatly in a “three-way” pattern. Flower spikes arise from the leaf axils in the late summer. Three-way sedge thrives in a very wet habitat.",
