  "description": "Grass-leaved Goldenrod is a rhizomatous, sometimes aggressive species and therefore may not be suitable for small landscape plantings. It will grow in dry to somewhat wet soils although it prefers full sun. This species is not a true goldenrod, and for that reason it is now classified in a different genus as Euthamia graminifolia.",
