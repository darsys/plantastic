  "description": "Baptisia sphaerocarpa prefers full sun and average to dry soil.  Like all of its genus, it is slow to establish but long-lived. The beautiful large yellow blossoms of Large Yellow Wild Indigo project proudly above its foliage in June and July.  The marble-sized round seed pods distinguish this species from other Baptisias.  Species of genus Baptisia are legumes.\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.    Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
