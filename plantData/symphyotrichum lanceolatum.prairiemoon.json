  "description": "Symphyotrichum lanceolatum, previously called Aster simplex, can vary in height, up to 5'.  It seems to thrive in disturbed areas and can form dense colonies.  Common to medium-wet and full-sun sites, it is a white-blooming Aster that can be distinguished by the pronounced curling habit of its dead leaves: they often spiral around the plant's stem.  Other common names: Lance-leaved Aster; White Panicled Aster Other botanical names: Symphyotricum simplex; Aster lanceolatus",
