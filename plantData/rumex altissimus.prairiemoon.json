  "description": "Pale Dock is typically found in wet soils along streams and other moist-soil situations.  It can also tolerate medium-moist soils and somewhat shaded areas.  It is most conspicuous later in summer when the seeds turn a russet red-brown color, which contrasts with the dominant green vegetation.",
