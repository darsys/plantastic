  "description": "Common Ironweed (Vernonia fasciculata) is usually referred to simply as \"Ironweed\". This stately plant offers a large cluster of unusually brilliant purple flowers on top of 6' tall, unbranched stems; a sight to see late summer and into fall.. Dark green, coarsly-toothed leaves add to the overallI interest.  It works well as a tall backdrop plant but It can be considered aggressive so may not be suitable for a small landscape planting. The seeds are fluffy and brown and disperse nicely in the wind. Ironweed can be started outdoors with fall planting or after two months of moist-cold stratification. It will thrive in moister soils with full to partial sun. Ironweed is a host plant for the American Painted Lady butterfly and is listed by the Xerces Society as having special value to native bees. Potted plants come in trays of 38 and ship when all plants in the tray are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
