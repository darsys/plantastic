  "description": "Growing in bushy clumps, Red Baneberry bears fluffy clusters of small white flowers in spring. The berries that ensue in mid to late summer are brilliant red, though sometimes white, without the characteristic dark spot of Actaea pachypoda (Doll's Eyes). Baneberry plants are poisonous and should never be eaten.  *This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.Â  Please note the germination code.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
