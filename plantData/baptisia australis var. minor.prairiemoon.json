  "description": "Dwarf Blue Indigo is a perennial wildflower that forms a small \"shrub\" shape; excellent for landscaping. Smaller than, but similar to, its cousin Baptisia australis, Baptisia minor prefers full-sun, well-drained sites and is tolerant of heat and drought.  Species of genus Baptisia are legumes.\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.    Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
