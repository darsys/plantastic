  "description": "Willow Aster is an attractive autumn bloomer that often forms dense colonies, spreading aggressively by rhizomes. Its blue-violet flowers cluster at the top of their stems.Â  Symphyotrichum praealtum gets its common name from its long, narrow willow-like leaves, which grow alternately along the stem and feature pronounced veins along their lower surface.   Another scientific name in use is Aster praealtus.",
