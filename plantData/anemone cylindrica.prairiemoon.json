  "description": "Thimbleweed has a tall, upright stem rising from clumped basal leaves with a whorl of three or more deeply-lobed leaves. The greenish white flowers fruit into a greenish white elongated cluster that resembles the rough part of a thimble. In Greek mythology, a jealous goddess transformed the nymph Anemone into a flower, eternally at the mercy of the north wind.Â  Also called Long-Fruited Thimbleweed, Anemone cylindrica prefers dry, open spaces.",
