  "description": "Symphyotrichum urophyllum tolerates most sun conditions and sets large, showy clusters of white-blue blossoms in autumn, often causing its wide-set branches to bend. The arrow-like leaves are heart-shaped at the base with fine teeth on the edges and few if any hairs.  The central disks of the 1/2-inch compound flowers at first appear cream or light yellow but become reddish purple with age, surrounded by only 8-18 pale ray petals.  Also called Aster sagittifolius.",
