  "description": "An attractive biennial native for rocky, shallow-soil sites and cooler climates.  Easy to start from seed, it has light to dark pink tubular flowers with yellow tips and greenish-blue leaves.  Being a biennial, it will have basal rosettes at ground-level the first year and flowering plants the 2nd year.  It could fill in any bare spot in a sun or semi-shade garden quite quickly.   Also know as Rock Harlequin, Tall or Pink Corydalis, and Capnoides sempevirens, it is a member of the Fumitory family, like the similar-looking Dutchman's Breeches. It is listed as endangered or threatened in several states.",
