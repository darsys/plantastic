  "description": "It would be difficult to tell Prairie Spiderwort apart from the popular Ohio Spiderwort if not for its small stature. At just one foot, it is the shortest of the Midwest Spiderworts.   It successfully spreads by seed and by underground rhizomes in dry, often sandy, sunny prairies.  It may also be referred to as Long-bracted Spiderwort.",
