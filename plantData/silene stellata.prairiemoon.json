  "description": "Silene stellata (Starry Campion or Widowâ€™s Frill) belongs to a large genus that is related to carnations. Its species all have five-petaled flowers that are enclosed at their base by a bell-shaped light green calyx with five teeth along its upper rim. Starry Campion should not be confused with the similar-looking naturalized weed, Bladder Campion (Silene vulgaris) which features the most inflated calyx pouch.  Each of the frilled white petals of this scentless flower has 8-12 intricate narrow lobes. Pollination is mainly by moths. This hardy, drought-tolerant plant reseeds itself, with older plants sometimes sprouting multiple stems from the deep taproot. The leaves on both ends of the often-unbranched round central stem are usually opposite, with the middle leaves in whorls of four.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
