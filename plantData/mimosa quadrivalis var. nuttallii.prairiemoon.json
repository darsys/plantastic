  "description": "Sensitive Plant prefers sunny, sandy sites.  It goes by many names: Littleleaf Sensitve-briar, Schrankia uncinata, and Mimosa microphylla.  Its leaves fold when disturbed, hence its common name. From May-July plants (2-3' tall) bloom in bunches of pink-magenta flower globes, which set seeds in long, prickly pods. Despite the barbs, the pods are nutritious for foraging mammals. The plant's vining stems also are covered by small, backward-curving thorns (see photo). The plant gives off a sulfur smell. This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.",
