  "description": "Obedient Plant thrives in wetter soils. The common name of this species has everything to do with its flowers and nothing to do with its behavior in the garden. It is a rhizomatous plant so its root system will spread fairly quickly underground. Anyone who has played around with its flower spikes will notice the curious fact that individual flower stems will remain in whichever direction you point them in.  This is a wonderful species if you need a plant to fill in large spots around your yard. Like all members of the mint family, it produces copious amounts of nectar. Blooming late summer and well into fall, obedient plant provides a much-needed boost of energy for pollinators facing the coming winter. The Narrow-leaved Obedient Plant has lighter pink flowers and blooms earlier, making it a nice companion plant.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
