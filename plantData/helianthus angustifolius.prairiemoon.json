  "description": "NEW! This late blooming sunflower is an excellent choice for a damp sunny spot in a garden.  Its salt tolerance makes it suitable for coastal gardens as well.  Swamp Sunflower has attractive, dark green foliage throughout the growing season and puts on a show of bright yellow blooms in the fall.  Unlike other species in its genus, Helianthus angustifolius doesn't spread aggressively, but rather forms a gradually growing clump.Swamp Sunflower grows in sunny wet habitats throughout the southeastern U.S., you may even see it in roadside ditches.  The leaves can serve as a host plant for the Silvery Checkerspot butterfly among others.  By attracting butterflies and caterpillars, it offers a food source for many species of birds including waxwings, orioles, thrushes, and cardinals.",
