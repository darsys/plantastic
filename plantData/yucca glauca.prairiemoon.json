  "description": "Soapweed Yucca is a member of the Agave family (Agavaceae).  Like Agaves, Yucca glauca (Soapweed) forms a clump of narrow, tough, blade-like pale green leaves that extend out from a central, woody, almost tree-like stalk.  These leaves are very sharp!  Older plants usually have multiple stalks and will form a large spiky clump. Members of this family are from tropical or very dry, hot areas so it is most unusual to have this native Yucca in a colder climate like the Upper Midwest.  A plant will take many years to flower, and seeds will not be produced each.  It is dependant on pollination by various butterflies and moths.  In fact, The Prairie Ecologist - Chris Helzer, published this fascinating blog about the co-dependancy of Yucca glauca and a moth.The Pollinator Program at The Xerces Society lists this plant as having special value to beneficial insects because it \"provides Nesting Materials/Structure for Native Bees; A plant that native bees nest beneath, within, or harvest parts from to construct their nests.\"Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
