  "description": "All prairie plants are fabulous, of course, but White False Indigo is truly a marvel among plants. Baptisia lactea (or B. alba) begins its growth cycle in spring when a slender smokey-purple stem emerges from the ground looking like a dark colored asparagus shoot. By late June it has transformed into a six foot tall, startling beautiful, flowering perennial. Long architectural spikes bearing rows of white blooms arise from a base of gray/blue foliage - all elevated on sturdy forked stems.\nIndividual White False Indigo plants are very long-lived. Young transplants can take several (up to four) years of development before they are full grown and producing flowers. The plants have a deep taproot and will not respond well to being moved, so site them carefully. Mature plants can get quite large, with a leafy growth diameter up to four feet wide.\nBaptisias support many pollinators, especially bumble bees, and is a larval host plant for several species of butterflies and moths.",
