  "description": "Common Evening Primrose grows in recently disturbed soils of prairies, old fields, roadsides and other sunny medium to dry sites.  It is a biennial; it grows vegetatively during the first year and completes its life cycle during the second but will re-seed.  It can reach heights of 6' in the right conditions but is often shorter.  Although labeled as a weed by some, it is a very important native plant with a long bloom time benefiting nectaring moths, butterfiles, caterpillars and many kinds of bees.  Common Evening Primrose is one of the last natives blooming late into fall.",
