  "description": "Wild Petunia's claim to fame is its lovely violet flower trumpets, a hummingbird favorite! Seldom growing more than a foot tall, this rare plant is perfect for dry, hot locations such as rock gardens and dry sandy or rocky soils. Ruellia humilis also thrives in well-drained loam. Wild Petunia self seeds with seeds that explode, making it able to hold its own with larger, aggressive plants.",
