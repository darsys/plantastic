  "description": "Also called Rock Pink and Flower-of-the-Hour, Small-Flower Fame Flower is very similar to Talinum rugospermum (Fame Flower). Both plants are members of the Purslane family (Portulacaceae) that occupy a narrow ecological niche in dry, open, sandy locations with little competition. Small-flower Fame Flower is extremely drought tolerant, but is intolerant of fire. This plant is often found in dry, harsh environments where there is little fuel for fires, like rock outcroppings and on sand dunes along the Mississippi River.Another botanical name is Phermanthus parviflorus.",
