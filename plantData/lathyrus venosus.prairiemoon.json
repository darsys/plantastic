  "description": "A perennial vine, Veiny pea's bloom is a showy 3-6\" raceme of 5-30 individual pea-like flowers, with each flower comprising a rich magenta to pink upper lip with darker veins and white to pink lower wing petals. It spreads slowly by rhizomes so is not considered aggressive. This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.",
