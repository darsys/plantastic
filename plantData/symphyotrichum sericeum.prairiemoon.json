  "description": "The leaves of Silky Aster feel as soft as a good piece of milk chocolate in your mouth.  Both sides of the alternating leaves are\ncovered with fine hairs that lie flat, creating a lovely silvery green\nappearance.   It's worth growing for the attractive foliage alone!  This Aster sets many pretty violet-purple flowers (15-30 rays around a yellow disk) on wide-set branches early Fall and attracts a multitude of pollinators. Thriving in drier soils, Symphyotrichum sericeum reaches 1-2' in height.   Another scientific name in use is Aster sericeus.",
