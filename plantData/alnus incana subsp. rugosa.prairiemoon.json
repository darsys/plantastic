  "description": "Speckled Alder spreads rhizomatously and prefers moderately acidic soil in low, moist areas, often along streams and lakes. This large shrub earned its subspecies name from the wrinkled or rugose leaves. Frequently forming dense thickets, it is fast growing and sometimes aggressive in open fens and bogs.   It serves as a food source for many species: deer and beavers eat the bark, goldfinches eat the seeds, its leaves host the larvae of the green comma butterfly, and the larvae of the harvester butterfly eat the woolly aphids often found on this species. Alder shrubs also have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in the Frankia genus, the nodules on their roots a visual reminder.   It is also called Tag Alder, Alnus rugosa, and Hazel Alder. IL lists it as endangered.",
