  "description": "Before flowering, it can be easy to tell the White from the Purple Prairie Clover by looking at the leaves: narrow on the Purple, wide on the White Prairie Clover (see corresponding photo.) Another scientific name in use is Petalostemum candidum.  This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.    Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May).",
