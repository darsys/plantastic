  "description": "Black-eyed Susan is an opportunist that thrives easily in disturbed areas.  It has naturalized through most of the continent. A biennial, it blooms and completes its life cycle in its second year but will re-seed.  We include it as an early marker in almost all of our prairie and savanna seed mixes. For a long-lived perennial Black-eyed Susan, choose Sweet Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia subtomentosa).",
