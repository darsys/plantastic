  "description": "Found in full-sun, wetter settings, Bidens connata is similar to Bidens cernua but grows a little taller, can tolerate some shade, blooms later with blossoms more in the yellow-orange hues and has dark purple-black stems.  Purple-stemmed Tickseed is an annual; it completes its life cycle during one season but will re-seed.  Sticktights (see detailed seed picture) are the bur-like seeds of some Bidens species, so named because they stick to clothing, shoestrings, etc.   Another common name in use is Purplestem Beggartick.",
