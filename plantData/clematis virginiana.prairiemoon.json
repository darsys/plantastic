  "description": "The vine will grow best when supported by a fence or trellis in medium shade. Virgin's Bower can be confused with Sweet Autumn Clematis (Clematis terniflora or Clematis paniculata,) an aggressive Asian vine with sweet-smelling flowers that has escaped from cultivation. The fragrance and the leaves sets the two vines apart: Virgin's Bower leaves are jagged on the edges whereas Sweet Autumn Clematis has rounded leaves.  Virgin's Bower is a perennial vine that is nicknamed \"Prairie Smoke on a Rope\" for its similar looking seedhead to the famous prairie plant Geum triflorum (Prairie Smoke.)  It also may be referred to as Devil's Darning Needles.",
