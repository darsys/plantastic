  "description": "Limit 5 packets per customer please!  A petite, rare Milkweed.  We say the flowers are green but they can border on white or light pink, and fade to yellow as they age. The stem is a reddish-brown and is covered in tiny, soft hairs. As the common name implies, the leaves are indeed oval-shaped, large, and also covered in soft hairs.  It may also be referred to as Dwarf Milkweed.",
