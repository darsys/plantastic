  "description": "The most distinct features of this delightful, small, colorful plant are the alternate leaves that are palm-like and covered in a soft, velvet layer of hair, giving the leaves a silvery appearance. The stems are not sturdy and woody, so the plant may lean over or stay close to the ground, almost like shrubbery. From May through June, reddish-orange saucer-shaped flowers will bloom in clusters at the tips of the branches, adding a pop of color to any area.Â  It is primarily a western species, and the one and only documented sighting as far east as MN ended tragically as our friends at Minnesota Wildflowers share here.",
