  "description": "The Common Name, Monkey Flower, comes from the flowers' resemblance to a monkey's face. Typical of wetlands, this plant needs consistently moist soils and will slowly spread into a bushy plant, attractive in a landscape setting.  The purplish-blue small flowers can sometimes verge on pink or white and will bloom for 1 month or more in mid-summer.",
