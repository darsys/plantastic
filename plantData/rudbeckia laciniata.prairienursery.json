  "description": "The statuesque Green Headed Coneflower does well in wet soils that challenge most other plants. Rudbeckia laciniata hasÂ unusual green-centered flowers surrounded by bright yellow petals, on tall stems. Perfect for planting along streambanks and pond edges, it does best in full sun, but tolerates light shade. Easy to grow from seed, it often blooms in the first year when grown in cultivation.",
