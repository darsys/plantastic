  "description": "Violet Wood Sorrel is a low-lying (4\"), shy native with small, bell-shaped violet flowers that become white with greenish lines near the blossomâ€™s throat. Leaves and blossoms both open up to the sun, the latter exposing bright yellow anthers, and then fold with shade. Three oval-heart leaflets comprise each leaf. Native bees love this plant, which prefers well-drained soils. It wil spread readily from bulb offshoots that form small colonies in a short amount of time.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). In some growing seasons, dormant roots may be available for Summer (July) shipping.",
