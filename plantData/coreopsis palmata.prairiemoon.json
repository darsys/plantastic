  "description": "Prairie Coreopsis matures to a height of just 2'. It prefers medium to dry soil conditions and sets striking yellow flowers for 3-4 weeks, usually in June and July. Dead-head flowers to prolong bloom time.  It is tolerant of poor soils and drought and is deer resistant.  Beekeepers consider all Coreopsis species to be good honey sources. In the past, some American Indian tribes applied boiled Coreopsis seeds to painful areas of their bodies in order to relieve ailments such as rheumatism.   Other common names in use include Tickseed, Stiff Tickseed, and Stiff Coreopsis.\nPotted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
