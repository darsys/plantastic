  "description": "Cliff Goldenrod is a lovely, sturdy perennial that is crowned by large, fireworks-like spreads of yellow blossoms from late summer into early autumn. As the name suggests, it will thrive in sand, rock and other tough, dry conditions.  The species is considered rare in Southeastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois and has been listed as of special concern since 1984. The single, smooth-stemmed plant boasts deep green, leathery toothed leaves that decrease in size further up the stem, where the flowers are found in dense layers and disks. Before flowering, it may be difficult to tell Cliff Goldenrod from the more abundant Showy Goldenrod.  Goldenrods in general attract a variety of pollinators, butterflies and songbirds while also providing cover for small ground animals, and are deer resistant.Since the addition of Cliff Goldenrod onto the list of special concern, it has been found that recreational rock climbing causes significant damage to this and many other rare rock outcrop plant populations. There are no current conservation efforts in progress in Minnesota, so adding this beautiful plant to a rock outcropping may help it continue to thrive.",
