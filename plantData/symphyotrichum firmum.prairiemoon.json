Its white or pale blue flowers can be up to 1.5 inches wide and bloom for about three months, from August to October.  These plants can grow anywhere from from 3 to 8’ in height. Because they spread by rhizomes, plants can form large colonies.  Shining Aster is also known as Aster firmus and S. puniceum firmus.",
