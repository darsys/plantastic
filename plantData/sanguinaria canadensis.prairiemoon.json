  "description": "Bloodroot emerges from the ground in woodlands before the trees leaf out.  Plants display their beauty in 2 stages.  Stunning white blossoms appear for a very short time early spring, emitting a wonderful fragrance that attracts many kinds of early-flying bees.  At the flowering stage, a light green leaf is wrapped around the stem of the flower.  When the flower fades, the leaf opens in a very unique shape as large as 6\" in diameter.  Bloodroot will go dormant mid-summer.  *This species (in seed) may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.  Please note the germination code on the right.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
