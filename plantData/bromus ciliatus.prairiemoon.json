  "description": "As a cool season grass, Fringed Brome grows actively during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool. It can tolerate a wide array of sun but prefers moist soil. This grass can be found growing in prairies and marshes. This would make a great addition to a rain garden, bioswale, or wetland. As it grows in a clump, this provides habitat for birds and small mammals.This seed is sold as PLS (Pure Live Seed). For example, if you order 1 lb and the PLS is 80%, you receive 1.25 lbs of bulk seed.",
