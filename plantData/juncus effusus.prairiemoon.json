  "description": "Common Rush is the most widespread rush worldwide and the species that is cultivated most often. A fine accent near ponds, it is considered a wetland plant, but can thrive in medium soils. Its leafless stems are bright to dark green and tubular, tapering from a base about 1/16” in diameter to an average height of 2’. Its flowers poke out of a slit near the slender tip. Common Rush actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.",
