  "description": "Turtlehead is named for its pretty white blossoms which resemble a turtle head poking out from its shell.  It is an important host plant providing larval food for the lovely orange and brown Baltimore Checkerspot butterfly.  Its nectar also attracts other butterflies, bumblebees, and ruby-throated hummingbirds.  Turtlehead likes wet to moist soils and full to part sun. The plants have deep green foliage of lance-shaped leaves on upright stems and grow to 5 feet tall.  They make a good choice for border and wet meadow plantings and will provide for a late summer bloom. Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May).",
