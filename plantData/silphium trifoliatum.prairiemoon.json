  "description": "Whorled Rosin Weed is a perennial forb for full to partial shade. Its leaves attach to the stem in a 'whorled' formation (see photo). Although it shares a similar common name with Silphium integrifolium (Rosin Weed), the plants are noticeably different. Like other species of Silphium, it features large yellow composite flowers blooming late summer, similar to a sunflower.",
