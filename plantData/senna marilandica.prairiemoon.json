  "description": "Senna marilandica is virtually indistinguishable from its relative, Wild Senna (Senna herbecarpa) until the 2 species have ripe seeds. The Wild Senna will readily open its pod and the seeds will fall out, whereas the Maryland Senna seed pods will stay tightly closed. For this reason, as wild turkey food, it's good to plant both Sennas; the Wild Senna will feed them in early fall as the seeds fall out of the pod, and the Maryland Senna's heavy, fibrous pods with seeds intact will sustain them during the later winter months.  TThis is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.",
