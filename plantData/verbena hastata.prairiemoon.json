  "description": "The small, tubular, blue-violet flowers of Blue Vervain bloom from the bottom up in July's heat.  The numerous crowning spikes of blossoms give a candelabra-like appearance to this graceful, widely-distributed plant.  As the alternative name Swamp Verbena suggests, this Vervain likes wet, even soggy, conditions but also will grow in medium soils.  Full sun to partial sun are its preferred sun conditions. \n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
