  "description": "Mud Plantain is also called American Water Plaintain and Alisma plantago-aquatica.  It sends up a flowering stem from their clumped base leaves. The small flowers have white or pink-tinged petals. Ribbon-like leaves formed underwater rarely are seen on adult plants because they tend to rot.  A typical emergent aquatic plant, Mud Plantain's lower part is often below water while its upper part is exposed.",
