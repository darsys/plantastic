  "description": "Woodland Knotweed can be identified by its long stem growing up from a cluster of leaves close to the ground. Along this stem are alternating white flowers. Out of these flowers will eventually be oval shaped seeds that have a hooked tip, which will “jump” off the plant when touched, earning its other common name, Jumpseed.  It is also called Virginia Knotweed and Polygonum virginianum.Woodland Knotweed prefers light shade and medium to moist soils typical of a woodland edge. It seems to be of little interest to rabbits and deer and makes a nice accent plant in a woodland garden.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
