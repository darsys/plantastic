  "description": "There is wide variety in flower color on Prairie Phlox, from nearly white to shades of light and dark purple and pink with a slight fragrance. The shape of any Phlox is a good example of how it has evolved with the needs of the butterfly visitor in mind. The flat, broad petals serve as a landing area and the deep and narrow tube in the center of the flower is ideal for a butterfly or moth tongue.Â  Prairie Phlox is also often called Downy Phlox for the somewhat hairy appearance of the stems and leaves.*Our experience is that this Phlox can be difficult from seed. For best results, Fall plant seed outdoors on a prepared site (germ code M).Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
