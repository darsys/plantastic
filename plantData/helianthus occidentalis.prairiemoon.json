  "description": "Western Sunflower is well-behaved, compared to some of the more aggressive Helianthus species. Its appearance is very delicate with just a few small leaves at the bottom of the plant and small flowers at the top of 3' red stems. It spreads by rhizomes on mostly sunny sites with medium to dry soils.",
