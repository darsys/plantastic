  "description": "Mistflower reaches up to two feet in height with downy, purplish, branching stems in moist or low savanna settings. Its opposing, large-toothed leaves are oval to triangular.  Resembling a lovely blue-purple fog when found in dense stands, the disk flowers form in clusters of 35-70 at the tops of stems in late summer and autum, attracting late-season butterflies.  Its habit of spreading by rhizomes leads William Cullina of the New England Wildflower Society to advise that in a garden setting Mistflower needs \"frequent thinning and division to keep vigorous.\"  Other common names in use: Hardy Ageratum, Wild Ageratum or Blue Boneset. It was formerly classified as Eupatorium coelestinum.Potted plants (3-packs) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June.",
