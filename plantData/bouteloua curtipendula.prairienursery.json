  "description": "The bright purple and orange flowers of this short grass make it especially attractive. Sideoats Grama is equally appealing when in seed, when the small oat-like seeds are suspended on one side of the stalk. Very effective when planted with other short prairie grasses and flowers in a meadow landscape. This beautiful native grass is a larval host plant for several Skipper butterflies and the Saturniid moth, Hemileuca oliveae - the Range Caterpillar moth.",
