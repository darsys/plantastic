  "name": "allium stellatum",
  "commonname": "prairie onion",
  "description": "Well-suited to rock gardens and dry-mesic areas like rock outcroppings, Prairie Onion is similar to its cousin Nodding Onion, except for its solid, upright stem and stature. It is deer/rabbit resistant and many pollinating insects will visit the late summer blooms.  It is easy to grow from seed but may take many years for a flowering plant - for this reason it may be best to buy a few roots as they respond to yearly bulb divisions well.  Most of the Allium species are edible.  Other common names include: Autumn Onion, Wild Onion or Cliff Onion.",
