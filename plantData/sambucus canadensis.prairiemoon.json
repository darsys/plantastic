  "description": "Elderberry forms large (to 10') bushes on mostly sunny sites with medium-dry to medium-wet soils.  Large clusters of fragrant white flowers attract pollinators June-July.  Edible berries ripen to a deep red-purple. Birds and mammals relish the fruit.  Stems can die back but new shoots emerge from the root mass.Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). This bare root tree is 1 year old and we trim to a height of approximatley 18-24\".",
