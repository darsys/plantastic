  "description": "A robust grower, the sharply four-sided stem of Yellow Giant Hyssop reaches heights from three to eight feet. In late summer its branching top is crowned by a long cylindrical spike of clustered yellow to yellow-green flowers. This favorite of bees, butterflies, and other pollinators prefers growing in rich, open woodlands. While the leaves donâ€™t have a strong smell like other species in the mint family, the bitterness of its leaves make it deer resistant.",
