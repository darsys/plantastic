  "description": "A very versitile sedge that is great in a landscape. Consider it for those difficult dry, shady spots and as a groundcover. It can tolerate dry to medium-wet sites with full shade or semi-shade. It has very narrow, fine leaves and a slight rose tint to the seedhead gives it its latin name, Carex rosea.  Curly-styled Wood Sedge, like most sedges, is a cool-season plant meaning it actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.   Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
