  "description": "A great choice to combat invasive Reed Canary Grass near water's edge. Cord Grass is a warm season grass; it actively grows during the summer when soil temperatures are warm.Â  It is aggressive and spreads by rhizomes so therefore may not be suitable for small landscape plantings. This seed is sold as PLS (Pure Live Seed). For example, if you order 1 lb and the PLS is 80%, you receive 1.25 lbs of bulk seed.",
