  "description": "Also called Carolina Rose, it grows fine in partial shade but abundant flowering and disease-resistance occur in full sun. It is a fairly low-growing, suckering shrub with very attractive flowers followed by equally-stunning fall rose hips. They are all also semi-aggressive and less suitable for small landscapes. *This species (in seed) may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and\ngrow to maturity.  Please note the germination code. Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Spring (April/May). This bare root tree is 1 year old and we trim to a height of approximately 12-18\".",
