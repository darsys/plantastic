  "commonname": "big-leaved aster",
  "description": "Big-Leaved Aster gets its common name from its large, heart-shaped foliage, which has coarse-toothed edges reaching 8\" across.. It's often planted for these large leaves as a shaded ground cover rather than for the sometimes sparse fall flowers. The flowering stems reach one to two feet in height, topped by blossoms with 9 to 20 thin, white-violet rays surrounding a yellow center. Eurybia macrophylla is common to northern woodlands, where it often forms a dense ground cover, spreading by rhizomes.  Another scientific name in use is Aster macrophyllus Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (3-packs) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June.",
