  "description": "The name Hydrophyllum means 'water'; notice how the early season leaves of the Virginia Waterleaf appear to have water droplets (see corresponding photo above). Virginia Waterleaf is a classic Northwoods plant but can be aggressive and rhizomatous and therefore may not be suitable for small landscape plantings.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
