  "description": "Like most Sedges, its most attractive (and most photographed) phase is during its mid-summer fruiting period. Carex vulpinoidea is one of the most abundant and easy-to-grow sedges in a variety of sun and soil conditions. The common name is derived from the seed head which resembles a fox's tail. Like most sedges, it actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.    Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
