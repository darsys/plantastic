  "description": "All parts of the plant are very aromatic. The small pink to purple flowers appear along the stem and are almost covered by large, hairy leaves. Wild Mint is classified as of \"special value to native bees\" for the large number of bees it can feed by The Xerces Society. Â  Mentha arvensis is rhizomatous and aggressive and therefore may not be suitable for small landscape plantings.",
