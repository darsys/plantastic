  "description": "Like its smaller, more common cousin, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Green Dragon thrives under a variety of conditions, but grows most vigorously in moist, shady, seasonally wet locations. It is also deer resistant!  It has a slimmer spadix or \"Jack,\"  the spongy, many-flowered cylindrical structure, that extends beyond the spathe or \"pulpit\", the leaf-like structure rolled around the spadix, without the overhanging roof or striped purple color of Arisaema triphyllum. It also has just one leaf comprised of 5-15 leaflets arranged in a semi-circle. The fruits are smooth, shiny green, 1 cm wide berries, clustered on the thickened spadix, that ripen in late summer and fall, turning a bright orange-red color before the plants go dormant.  *This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.  Please note the germination code.",
