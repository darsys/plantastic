  "description": "Purple Love Grass is a perennial, warm season grass that grows actively during the summer when soil temperatures are warm. It reaches heights of 1-2 feet even in the driest, poorest of soils. It thrives in full sun and sandy sites - even roadsides that receive winter road salt. Purple Love Grass can also grow under Black Walnut trees where other plants fail.  The seed heads (or florets) bloom mid-summer in shades of light to bright purple, giving an overall purple haze to the landscape. This tough ornamental grass is an absolutely stunning addition to any rock garden or drier landscape.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
