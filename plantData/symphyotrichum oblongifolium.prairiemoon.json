The stiff stems will branch out slowly to create a bush-like appearance and will completely covered in light purple flowers when blooming.  The flowers will turn reddish purple as they mature.  Full sun and drier soils are preferred but average soil is tolerated if it drains well.  Despite the name, the flowers have no aroma, but the leaves do when crushed.  Another scientific name in use is Aster oblongifolius.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June.
