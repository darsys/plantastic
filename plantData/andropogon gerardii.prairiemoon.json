  "description": "Big Bluestem is a warm season grass; it actively grows during the summer when soil temperatures are warm.  It is a big plant, getting over six feet tall in most situations.  In a landscape it can be used as an accent.  It has great fall color in the range of gold and pink.  So well-known as a 'must have' in any tallgrass prairie and a native range of most of North America, 'Big Blue' really has no other common names in use.\nThis seed is sold as PLS (Pure Live Seed). For example, if you order 1 lb and the PLS is 80%, you receive 1.25 lbs of bulk seed.\nDormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).\nPotted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
