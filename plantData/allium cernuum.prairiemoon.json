  "description": "Nodding Onion is stunning to have in gardens because of its unique flowers. A ball of star-like flowers forms on each stem, tending to bend downward; hence the name \"nodding\" onion.  The nodding habit may also protect the nectar from rain.  Native American tribes used the bulbs of Nodding Onion as a treatment for croup, colic, colds and fevers.  Allium cernuum blooms in midsummer, and the flowers are pollinated by small short-tongued bees, such as Halictid bees.  Nodding Onion, like all the Allium species, is deer-resistant.  Allium cernuum grows best in full or partial sun, and moist to medium conditions.  It tends to spread by seed and bulb offshoots.  The flowers are almost white to shades of purple in color and mature plants can reach up to 18\" in height.  This plant is easy to grow, and will spread gradually under suitable conditions.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May)",
