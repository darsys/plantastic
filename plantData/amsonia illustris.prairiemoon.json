  "description": "Featuring terminal clusters of star-like, light blue flowers, Amsonia illustris (Ozark Bluestar) grows to 3' tall and flowers in early to mid spring. The willow-like foilage stays shiny all summer and fall brings a beautiful display of golden leaves.  Ozark Bluestar prefers moist loamy soil, but will also grow successfully in medium to well-drained soils. If a managed appearance is desired some pruning or staking may be needed when planted in semi-shade or conditions with rich soil.  Hardy in zones 5-9; also referred to as Shining Blue Star. Potted plants (trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
