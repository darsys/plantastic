  "description": "A member of the Evening Primrose family, it is actually a day-flowering species. It spreads semi-aggressively and forms dense mats, but can be removed easily from a garden setting because of its shallow roots.  The bright yellow, fragrant flowers and photo-worthy stamens appear early summer.  Prairie Sundrops prefer moist soils and near full sun but can tolerate periods of drought and light shade.  Another common name in use is Meadow Evening Primrose.",
