  "description": "A large, fast-growing shrub, usually in the 7-9' range but it can reach to 10', especially in rich, moist soils. The dark red stems against a fresh white snow may be its most attractive season, but look forward to white flowers early-spring and white to pale blue fruit late summer.  These berries are a very important food source for a number of different kinds of wildlife in the fall and winter. Also known as Cornus sericea.     Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May). This bare root tree is 1 year old and we trim to a height of approximately 12-18\".",
