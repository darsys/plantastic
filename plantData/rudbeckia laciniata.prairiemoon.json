  "description": "There are not many woodland flowers that will reach the height of this coneflower. Its bright yellow flowers and relatively late bloom time compared to many spring-blooming woodland flowers make it a wonderful addition to your woodland planting. Wild Golden Glow is rhizomatous and can be aggressive so may not be suitable for small landscape plantings.  Other common names in use include Cut-leaved Coneflower, Cutleaf Coneflower, Green-headed Coneflower or Tall Coneflower.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
