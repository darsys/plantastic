  "description": "Callirhoe digitata is unique among Poppy Mallows: it stands tall instead of sprawling along the ground, earning it another common name, Standing Winecups; its petals are fringed along the outer edge, unlike other Callirhoe species; and its leaves are also finely divided, with few leaves on the upper stems.Â  Fringed Poppy Mallow is native to a small area of the lower Midwest and eastern Great Plains. We sell this seed dehulled, as in the seed image, above.",
