  "description": "Characteristic fine, soft, downy hairs cover the stems and leaves of Downy Sunflower, giving it a blueish-gray-green appearance. This classic composite Sunflower will bloom for many weeks in July-September.  Its preference is for poor, drier soils, those with gravel, rock or clay, where it will form dense stands. But it will do well and actually grow taller in nutrient-rich medium soils, too. There is evidence that the root system has an allelopathic agent that prevents other plants from growing around it.  Downy Sunflower is very aggressive--a quality some might look for, but in a small landscape setting it's a plant that could easily take over an entire area.  Also, removal of the seed head before the seed is ripe is preferable to weeding unwanted seedlings.",
