  "description": "You can never have too many Camassias in a prairie, savanna or open woodland. They will grow well in a variety of soils. After flowering in the spring, Camassias will go dormant for the rest of the year.Â  They are slow to establish from seed so you may considering transplants for landscape settings.  Another name for Southern Wild Hyacinth is Prairie Camas.Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May). In some growing seasons, dormant roots may be available for summer (July-Aug) shipping.",
