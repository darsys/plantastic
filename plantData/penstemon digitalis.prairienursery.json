  "description": "Penstemon digitalis is one of the few Penstemons that thrives in clay. The white flowers bloom for a month or longer, and look great with the blue flowers of Ohio Spiderwort and Blue Eyed Grass. At 3' high this clump-forming perennial does well in full sun to light shade, and tolerates seasonally damp conditions.\nThe tubular flowers attract long-tongued bees such as bumblebees and mason bees, as well as hummingbirds. Other common names include Foxglove Beardtongue and Mississippi Beardtongue.",
