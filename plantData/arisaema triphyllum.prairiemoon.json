  "description": "Jack-in-the-Pulpit is an excellent woodland garden plant.  It is easy to cultivate and requires very little care once established.  It thrives under a variety of conditions, but grows most vigorously in moist, shady, seasonally wet locations.  Deer will not eat this plant!  The \"Jack\" is the spongy cylindrical structure, inside a leaf-like structure that is rolled into a deep cup with an overhanging roof, the \"pulpit\".  The fruit are smooth, shiny green, 1 cm wide berries clustered on the thickened spadix and ripen in late summer and fall, turning a bright red color before the plants go dormant.  *This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.  Please note the germination code.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
