  "commonname": "heath aster",
  "description": "Heath Aster is very easy to grow in medium to dry soils.  It is rhizomatous and will self-seed readily, so some may consider it aggressive.  It will spread 1+ feet per year. Heath Aster will do well in USDA zones 3-10.  Other names commonly used include Aster ericoides or White Heath Aster.  The white ray flowers can occasionally look light blue or pale pink, with a yellow center. In a planting without much other vegetation to support it, Heath Aster may need to be staked or it will droop over.  The white flowers explode profusely all along the stem of the plant in late summer and early fall, providing that last bit of bloom to a garden before winter.",
