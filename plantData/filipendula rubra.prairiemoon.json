  "description": "Queen of the Prairie is known for its beautiful spray-like clusters of pink flowers that make it a stand out and give it its regal name. The leaves are large and deeply lobed on zigzag stems, and the plants grow to 5 feet tall. It's best grown in full sun (although they can take some shade), and prefers moist to wet soils. The roots are rhizomatous and will spread, which makes it a great plant for naturalizing in moist meadows, but be aware of the semi-aggressive nature in small garden settings.  *This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.Â  Please note the germination code on the right. Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May).",
