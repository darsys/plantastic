  "description": "Rudbeckia triloba’s many common names include Brown-Eyed Susan, Branched Coneflower, Thin-Leaved Coneflower and Three-Lobed Coneflower. Its native range extends from New York to Minnesota and south to Utah and Texas. The plant’s dark green basal leaves are slightly hairy and are divided into three oval parts, hence the species name.  While it prefers moderate moisture, Brown-eyed Susan tolerates most conditions, including drought, once it is established. A short-lived perennial, it self-seeds readily, flowering in its second year. Its abundant bright yellow flowers are flat, one to two inches across, with jet black centers that fade to brown. Blooming from late summer until hard frost, Rudbeckia triloba reaches two to five feet tall and becomes bushy if not crowded by other plants. It makes an excellent cut flower and complements any of the tall native grasses and common prairie wildflowers (see 'Other Considerations' below). \n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). Potted plants (trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
