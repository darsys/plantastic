  "description": "Wafer Ash, also known as Common Hop Tree, is a small, deciduous,understory shrub or tree with a thin, crooked trunk. This multi-stemmed tree is found from rocky slopes to river valleys, savannas, thickets, and woodlands. It can withstand somewhat-degraded habitats. The root system of Wafer Ash is branching; however, offspring are not produced from runners.It is the northernmost American species in the Rue (Citrus) family and a host for the Giant Swallowtail caterpillar, as the butterfly will only lay eggs on plants in the Citrus family. The flowers of Wafer Ash are greenish-white in color and are found in clusters. Their short 2-week blooming period begins in May. This species is monoecious, meaning that each plant produces both male and female flowers. Each flower is about a quarter-inch across. Male flowers lack the central pistil while females lack anthers and stamens. Flowers will attract bees, flies, and ants. After the blooming period, the tree bears wafer-like samara, a one-seeded, winged fruit. The fruit usually spans a diameter of ¾-inch. The fruit has been used as a substitute for hops in beer and the root bark has been employed in home remedies.",
