  "description": "Preferring moist soil, Napaea dioica (Glade Mallow) grows 4-10' tall and displays large, coarsely toothed leaves. Blooming from June through August, the showy tubular flowers have a pleasant fragrance and form a compact panicle. The root system of N. dioica consists of a large, hollow, taproot that may branch. The leaves will wilt rapidly if allowed to dry out.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
