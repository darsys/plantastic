  "description": "At home in full sun and wetter soils, Bidens aristosa sports brilliant yellow-gold blossoms in late summer and fall. Swamp Marigold is an annual; it completes its life cycle during one season but will re-seed.Â  Unlike most Bidens or Beggar's Ticks/Tickseed species, the Swamp Marigold's awns are absent so the seed will not easily attach to clothing, shoelaces or fur.",
