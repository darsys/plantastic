  "description": "This is a Phlox for shade or partial shade and medium to drier soils.  Wild Blue Phlox is rhizomatous and will spread slowly but steadily. It is also commonly referred to as Blue Phlox, Woodland Phlox, or Louisiana Phlox. Some may call it Wild Sweet William, but that is the common name we give to Phlox maculata.  The flowers, atop sticky stems, are slightly fragrant and range in color from pale blue to lavender to violet. Deer seem to have little interest in Phlox, but rabbits especially like Wild Blue.  *This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity.  Please note the germination code below.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
