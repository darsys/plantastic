  "description": "Bare Root Plants ship spring only.  Lobelia siphilitica offers a deep-hued counterpoint to the yellows of late summer. It can form colonies of richly-flowered spikes, 2-3’ ft. tall, in medium to wet soils, especially with a little shade. Lobelias produce a secondary compound known as \"lobeline,\" which deters herbivores.\nDormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Spring (April/May).Potted plants (trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
