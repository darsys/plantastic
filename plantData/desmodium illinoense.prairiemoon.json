  "description": "With white to pink pea-like flowers, Desmodium illinoense (Illinois Tick Trefoil), grows to a height of 3-6 feet and thrives in dry to moderate soil types. The oblong seed pods are densely covered with hooked hairs which stick to hair or clothing. In sandy conditions D. illinoense may have a potential to become aggressive. This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
