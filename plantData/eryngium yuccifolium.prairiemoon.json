  "description": "Eryngium yuccifolium (Rattlesnake Master) matures to a height of 4' and has white \"bristly\" flowers.  It is typically found in medium-wet to medium soils and prefers sites with full sun.  The latin name, Eryngium yuccifolium, comes from the fact that the leaves look very much like a Yucca plant.  In the past Rattlesnake Master has been used medicinally by Native Americans as a diaphoretic. The roots have also been used to treat liver troubles.  Other common names include Button Snakeroot, Yucca-leaf Eryngo, Corn Snakeroot, Water-eryngo, Rattlesnake Flag, and Rattlesnake Weed.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
