  "description": "With white to pale lavender blooms early-fall, this plant is a member of the Aster family. Lion's Foot is for full to part shade and the height greatly depends on the moisture and light of a given area; 2' in drier, very shady sites and 4' in dappled light with moister soils.  Notice the \"lion's-foot\" shape of the leaf in the photograph.  Other common names include Rattlesnake Root and White Lettuce.   Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
