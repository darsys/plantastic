  "description": "Mad-dog Skullcap, also known as Blue Skullcap, is a mint-family perennial plant with toothed, opposite leaves and a square stem, which is typically hairless. It blooms small, trumpet-shaped flowers, varying in color from pale blue to lavender or even white, from June through October. Mad-dog Skullcap is easily identified by the small size of its flowers, usually found in pairs or single.This lovely plant thrives in wet-to-moist conditions and is rhizomatous but not aggressively so.  It is bitter and slightly toxic to deer and rabbits (always a great bonus), but also does not attract a lot of pollinators. The common name of “skullcap” is a reference to the cap shape of the flower and seed capsules, slightly resembling helmets worn by military during the Middle Ages.",
