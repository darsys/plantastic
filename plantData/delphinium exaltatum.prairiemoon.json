  "description": "This Larkspur has a much later bloom time than other Delphinium species. It is blooming in July when others, like Dwarf Larkspur, are already dormant.  Many shades of purple, from a deep violet to a pale lavender, can appear in one small population of plants, as represented in the photos.  These tubular flowers are a favorite of hummingbirds and bumblebees.  The palmate leaves are large and attractive.It has a limited native range and would likely winter-kill in zone 3 and does not respond to hot, humid climates beyond zone 8. The plant is poisonous to herbivores like deer and rabbits so makes a nice choice in a landscape, but tall, thin stems may require some staking or support.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
