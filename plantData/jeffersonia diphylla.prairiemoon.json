  "description": "If not for the distinct butterfly-looking 'twinleaves', the single white flower blooming early spring very much resembles Bloodroot.Â Twinleaf tolerates and may prefer calcareous soils, which are alkaline with a pH of 7 to 8.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
