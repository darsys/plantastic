  "description": "Forked Aster begins to bloom in July, much earlier than most Asters. Its white petals radiate from a yellow disk and turn pinkish with age. The thick, stiff leaves have fine-toothed edges and hairy undersides. Eurybia furcata is self-incompatible; it requires cross-pollination and often fails to produce seed. Its spread usually is through rhizomes, with runners emerging up to 16 inches from the main plant.  Another scientific name in use: Aster furcatus Another common name in use: Midwestern White Heart-Leaved Aster  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
