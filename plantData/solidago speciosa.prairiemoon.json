  "description": "Showy Goldenrod tends to bloom a little later than most Goldenrods. It is indeed one of the showiest of the genus with a feathery plume comprised of a dense clump of pale yellow to deep yellow flowers atop an attractive red stem.  Other late-blooming natives of the same mesic to dry soils that might accent Showy Goldenrod include Button Blazing Star, Sweet Black-eyed Susan, and Stiff Gentian.   Whatever your preference or situation may be, there is a goldenrod to suit all occasions. Sadly, goldenrods often get blamed for causing the dreaded hayfever. This is simply not true. Their pollen is quite large and sticky so as to better adhere to the body of visiting insects. Because of this, goldenrod pollen cannot become airborne and can never make its way into your sinuses. The true cause of hayfever is the wind pollinated ragweeds, which broadcast copious amounts of lightweight pollen into the air. We cannot stress enough how important goldenrods are on the landscape. Including them on your property will provide ecosystem services well into the fall when most other plant life is shutting down.\nDormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October or Spring (April/May).Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
