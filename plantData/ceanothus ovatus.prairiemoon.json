  "description": "Also known as Narrow-leaved New Jersey Tea, Prairie Redroot and Ceanothus herbaceus, this is a gorgeous, smaller perennial shrub in the buckthorn family. Its round, white flowers yield black, triangular fruits. It is a woody plant that shoots several stems from the ground with alternating, toothed leaves that appear glossy or waxed. Red Root is a fan of sunny areas with well-drained soils. This plant is a hermaphrodite, meaning it has both male and female organs, and it can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Red Root draws a great variety of helpful insects, such as bees, wasps, flies and beetles in addition to those who impose destruction upon the foliage, like the leaf beetle. White-tailed deer and bobwhite quail readily consume the stems and foliage, making establishment of large stands difficult where those animals are over-populated. Our bare root shrub is shipped with approximately 6” of top growth.   Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May).",
