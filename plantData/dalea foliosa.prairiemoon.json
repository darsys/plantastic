  "description": "Once a strong presence in medium to dry soil prairies, this species is now on the brink of extinction in natural areas, occurring in small populations in just a few states. Loss of habitat and fire suppression have contributed to its decline. Its form is more leafy than other Prairie Clovers. This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1 \noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
