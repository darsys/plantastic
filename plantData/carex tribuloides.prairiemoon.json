  "description": "Lighter green blades extend from this medium-statured wetland Sedge that has a classic sedge-looking perigynia and spikelets that may appear similar to other low-land Carex.  Sedges are an important larvae host for various moths, skippers and butterflies. Grasshoppers and other invertebrates will feed on them and waterfowl and many songbirds will eat the seeds.  Awl-fruited Oval Sedge actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool. It is also called Blunt Broom Sedge.",
