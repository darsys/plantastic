  "description": "This modest legume sparsely produces yellow, pea-like summer flowers that give way to plump seed pods. When dry and shaken, the pods can produce a rattling sound. The foot-tall plant produces a taproot and reseeds itself when seed pods are distributed by wind. Rattlebox is an annual; it completes its life cycle during one season but will re-seed. It needs acidic soil with a pH of 4 to 6 and also requires sandy soils.  This is a legume species (member of the pea family).  Most legumes harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their roots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium called inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of legume seed.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I on the right.",
