  "description": "With impressive stature, leaves that can reach two feet wide and large umbrella-like flower structure, this species has an imposing presence.  It's not surprising that it has a long history of reputed medicinal and magical properties. Stately sentinels along stream beds, Angelica plants reach heights of six or more feet with hollow, smooth purple stems from one to two inches round.  Angelica tolerates and may prefer calcareous soils, which are alkaline with a pH of 7 to 8.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
