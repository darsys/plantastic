  "description": "Impatiens are popular annuals, completing their life cycles in one season. They self-seed with popping pods, but demand the patience implied by their botanical name if started from seed; double dormancy is required before the seed will germinate (see Germ Code F, right).  What's more, if you have ever seen a Jewelweed plant in bloom with dew hanging on it, the reason it is also called Jewelweed is obvious.Touch-me-not is a plant many people have interest in because some say it is an antidote to Poison Ivy and Stinging Nettle. This Orange Impatiens tends to like wetter soil than the Yellow - Impatiens pallida.  Another common name in use is simply Jewelweed, Orange Jewelweed or Orange Touch-me-not.",
