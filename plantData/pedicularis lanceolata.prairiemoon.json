  "description": "Marsh Betony is in the Figwort family (Scrophulariaceae) and is a hemiparasitic species that will often attach to a host plant (see Germination Code K on right). It is also referred to as Swamp Lousewort or Fen Betony. It is very different from Wood Betony (Pedicularis canadensis) in that it prefers a location that has more moisture, is much taller than Wood Betony, and blooms late summer into fall.",
