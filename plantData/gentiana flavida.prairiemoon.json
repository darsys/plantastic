  "description": "Cream Gentian are slow-growing but long-lived and require little care once established. Bumblebees are the main pollinators because they are the only insects strong enough to pry open the nearly-closed flowers. Cream Gentian is the first Gentian to bloom in late summer.Â  Bottle Gentian and others (see our website) may wait until September or October to lend late-season color to mostly sunny sites in medium-wet to medium-dry soils. Also known as Yellow Gentian and Gentiana alba.",
