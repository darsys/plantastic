  "description": "New! Sweet Goldenrod, part of the Aster (Asteraceae) family, is native to the North and South Eastern areas of the US.  It is clump-forming and makes a nice fall addition to any dry, even sandy, garden because it does not spread aggressively as some other Goldenrods may.  Also called Anise Scented Goldenrod, the nice-smelling leaves and dried flowers have been used to make tea.  It is deer-resistant.",
