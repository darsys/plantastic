  "description": "Illinois Rose works well as a \"living fence\" or border, making it a great substitute for the invasive, non-native Multiflora Rose.  It is a shrub with vine-like characteristics that can form a dense row (see photo).  It is also referred to as Climbing Wild Rose or simply, Prairie Rose.*This species (in seed) may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and\ngrow to maturity.  Please note the germination code.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). This bare root tree is 2 years old and we trim to a height of approximately 18-24\".",
