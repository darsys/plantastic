  "description": "Sweet Black Eyed Susan is a long-lived perennial. This deep rooted Rubeckia grows at the base to form large clumps with strong multiple stems that may also branch at the top – all resulting in an impressive floral display. The numerous blooms are larger than other rudbeckias, and persist similarly for many weeks, from late summer into fall. The plant has a pleasant sweet smell when blooming, similar to Sweet Grass, and many pollinators frequent the flowers.\nSweet Black Eyed Susan retains its luxuriant deep green foliage and butter-yellow blooms in the intense heat of summer when others may wilt. Give it clay, or any reasonably rich soil and it will reward you with years of beautiful flowers. Prefers a medium clay soil, in full sun and will also bloom in partial shade, but will not be as robust. Plants can be divided and moved in early spring.",
