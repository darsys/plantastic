  "description": "Narrow-leaved Obedient Plant is rhizomatous - a fairly fast-spreading underground root system. It has a lighter flower color and earlier bloom time than Obedient Plant.Â  If you like genus Physostegia, it's nice to have both of these in a planting.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
