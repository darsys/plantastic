  "description": "Dodecatheon amethystinum (Amethyst Shooting Star) produces a dramatic cluster of five parted, purple to pink colored blossoms. Fused petals face downward to produce a tube, ringed with maroon, yellow and white. Unlike it's relative D. meadia, Dodecatheon amethystinum survives in a very limited native range with populations confined to the steep limestone bluffs of the upper mid-west Driftless region, in addition to a small area of the Appalachians. Growing 4-18\" tall, Amethyst Shooting Star does well in medium soil types with nearly full shade to full sun.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: fall (October) or spring (April/May). In some growing seasons, dormant roots may be available for summer (July-Aug) shipping.",
