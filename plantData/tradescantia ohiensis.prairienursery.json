  "description": "The delightful blue flowers of Ohio Spiderwort bloom for an extended period in late spring and early summer. Plant them with Smooth Penstemon for a fantastic combination. The long bloom period and the spikey foilage make this easy-to-grow native an attractive addition in any garden or meadow.\nSpiderworts bloom profusely in the morning and early parts of the day, and tend to close-up in the heat of the afternoon, unless it is cloudy or cooler. This conservatives energy and allows the plant to flower over a longer period. Include some later-blooming prairie flowers and grasses near by, as the late summer foliage of spiderwort tends to look a little worn.",
