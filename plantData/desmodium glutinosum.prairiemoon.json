  "description": "Desmodium Glutinosum (Pointed-leaved Tick Trefoil) is a leguminous plant found in a woodland or woods edge situation. The color is a surprising clear pink tone that is highly visible on a woodland walk. The leaves are crowded together mostly in the middle of the plant and spray outward in a loose whorl. This is a legume species (member of the pea family).\nMost legume species harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their\nroots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium\ncalled inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of 1\noz. or less of legume seed.  Inoculum will keep refrigerated for approximately 1 year.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I.",
