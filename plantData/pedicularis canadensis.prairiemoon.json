  "description": "Wood Betony is a hemiparasitic species so even though it can photosynthesize it will often attach to a host plant, such as a short grass species (see Germination Code K on right). Wood Betony's leaves are red when emerging from the ground in early April (see corresponding photo). The yellow blooms look like a pinwheel when you view them from directly above and are a favorite of eary season bumblebees. Wood Betony can be easily identified by the early April-June bloom time and the preference for a somewhat dry or readily drained location. It is also called Canadian Lousewort.",
