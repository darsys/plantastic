  "description": "New!  The soft lavender to pinkish-gray flowers are somewhat brittle and sparse along this climbing perennial.  The trifoliate leaves tend to be more numerous in shady locations while the large flowers tend to be more numerous along the vine in sunny locations. Purple Clematis can be difficult to germinate from seed. Exposure to brief period of high heat (approx. 90 degrees F) may aid in germination.  Also called Purple Virgin's Bower, this Clematis is listed as rare or endangered in several states.",
