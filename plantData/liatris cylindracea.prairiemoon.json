  "description": "The shortest of the Liatris species at 1'.  It prefers dry soils and often blooms later than other Blazing Stars; enjoy it well into October.  It won't compete well so keep tall, aggressive plants away.  Also called Cylindrical Blazingstar.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
