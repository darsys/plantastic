  "description": "Showy Beardtongue is certainly showy with large flowers on a relatively short plant that can cover much of the stem.  The flowers are 2\" tubes in with dark purple lines and white blotches and have a range of color from white, to pink to violet and purple.  It will attract a number of pollinators and even though it may be short-lived it makes ample amounts of seed to re-sow.",
