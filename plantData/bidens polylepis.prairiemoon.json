  "description": "A strong grower, Bidens polylepis can become weedy in sunny, wet locations; its bright yellow blossoms are popular with insect pollinators in late summer and fall.Â  Bearded Beggarticks are an annual; they complete their life cycle during one season but will re-seed. It also differs in seeming not to require over-wintering for germination.",
