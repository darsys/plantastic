  "description": "Golden Alexanders is covered with brilliant golden umbels in late-spring. Growing only 1 - 2 feet tall, this is an excellent low-growing choice for heavy clay soils in semi-shade to full sun. As a member of the Apiaceae family, it is a host plant for the Black Swallowtail butterfly, which lays its eggs on several of the umbelliferous plants in this family, including Golden Alexanders, parsely, fennel and dill. ",
