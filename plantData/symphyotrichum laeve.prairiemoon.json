  "description": "The leaves on Smooth Blue Aster are indeed smooth to the touch. The similar-looking Sky Blue Aster (Symphyotrichum oolentangiense) has rough leaves, as do many other Asters.  The tough stem often takes on a shade of blue also and will allow Smooth Blue Aster to stand tall during its long late summer to mid fall bloom.  A non-aggressive rhizomatous root system allows the plant to spread slowly.  In a garden setting, Smooth Blue Aster will persist for many years if taller, aggressive plants are kept back.\n Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).Potted plants come in trays of 38 and ship when all plants in the tray are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
