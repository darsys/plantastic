  "description": "Also called Rock Sandwort and Minuartia dawsonensis or Minuartia michauxii, its long, tough root enables it to establish in cracks between rocks. Often found in limestone outcroppings, Stiff Sandwort is distinctive for its linear leaves and large white flowers despite its small stature. It requires dry, hot sites and sandy soils.Â This plant has a limited native range in the US; it is only native in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In Minnesota Stiff Sandwort is being considered to be elevated from Special Concern to Threatened due to agriculture and grazing diminishing its habitat. It is also a Special Concern plant in Wisconsin.",
