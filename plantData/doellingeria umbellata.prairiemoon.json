  "description": "Flat-topped Aster, Doellingeria umbellata, formerly Aster umbellatus, is a perennial, early bloomer in the Aster family, flowering in July with clusters of white petals and yellow center disks. As a plant ages, the color will dull, paling to a yellowish tan. The alternately-attached leaves are simple, rounded, toothless spears with short hairs that add texture. Flat-topped Aster begins to bloom in July, much earlier than most Asters, and is rhizomatous, meaning it spreads by underground rhizomes as well as by seed.This beautiful plant enjoys wet-to-moist, sandy prairies in full sunlight. A wide variety of pollinators are attracted to the nectar and pollen of the flowers. These species include long- and short-tongued bees, wasps, flies, beetles and butterflies. But, larger animals, like swamp sparrows, wild turkey, white-tailed deer and cottontail rabbits, also enjoy the foliage of the plant so keep it caged in the early years of establishment.",
