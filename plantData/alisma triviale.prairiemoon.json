  "description": "The oval basal leaves of Alisma triviale are about one-foot tall and form a rosette from which rises a whorled panicle of small white flowers, reaching a height of three feet during summer.  This species prefers full or partial sun and mucky soil or shallow, slow-moving, even stagnant water.  It withstands drought better than most aquatic plants.  Other Common Names in use: Northern Water Plantain.",
