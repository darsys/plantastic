  "description": "Cottonweed, also called Plains Snakecotton, is an annual; it completes its life cycle during one season but will re-seed.  During this one growing season, Cottonweed will put down a central taproot and dense, cone-like flowers will ensue late summer and last for a long period; 2 months or more. The tips of the white flower will take on a pink hue. These dense flowers then turn \"cottony\" as they mature, thus the common name.  Unusual flowers and a fuzzy central stem, usually unbranched, make it a very different looking plant.  A member of the Amaranth family, it thrives in the hottest, driest of conditions; sandy or gravelly sites, and often found today near railroads.  There is not a lot of research on plant-insect relations for Cottonweed; it is thought to be self-pollinating or wind-pollinated rather than by insects.",
