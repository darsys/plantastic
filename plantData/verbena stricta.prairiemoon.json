  "description": "Livestock will not eat Verbena so it may be thought of as \"weedy\" by some who observe it in a pasture setting. In a natural prairie it is not aggressive.  In fact, it is a rather short-lived perennial that will not compete well with more aggressive vegetation.  It self-seeds readily and is very easy to germinate, so it is a common component of many drier prairie seed mixes.  The seeds are a staple for many small mammals and birds that depend on this widely-distributed plant.  The gray-green leaves are fuzzy on both sides and are the larval host for the Common Buckeye Butterfly.  Also simply called Hoary Verbena, this Vervain has a long bloom time; the blue-purple flower spikes will persist for 4-6 weeks, usually spanning July and August.\n Potted plants (3-packs and trays of 38) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June. Click here if you prefer to mix/match up to 6 species in a tray.",
