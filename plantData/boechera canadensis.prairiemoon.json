  "description": "Sicklepod is a biennial plant (it will bloom the second year of its two-year life cycle) and prefers rocky soils. The first year of its life it will form a low rosette of leaves. The second year there will be a tall flowering stem that has alternate leaves. The nectar and pollen of the small white flowers attracts mainly small bees and flies. The fruit is a bean-shaped pod about four inches long. The individual seeds themselves are egg-shaped with a papery wrapping surrounding them. It was previously known scientifically as Arabis canadensis.  Another scientific name is Borodinia canadensis, and another common name is Canadian Rock Cress.",
