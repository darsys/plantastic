  "description": "NEW! Hairy Valerian, also referred to as Valeriana ciliata, Tobacco Root or Edible Valerian, is classified as Threatened in MN and 3 other states.  It was once more abundant in MN, but with large natural wet prairies and fens nearly gone, it clings to life in just a few rare pockets in the state.  It could also be found on drier sites but only if it has access to a vein of moisture.  The leaf hairs may be its most distinguishable feature; the leaves are smooth but have short, dense, white hairs on the outer edge, giving it a silvery glow. The seeds are distributed by the wind.",
