  "description": "One of the first flowers you may notice in spring could be a cluster of white bell flowers on Bladdernut.  The flowers form interesting bladder pods that persist through summer.  This is a woodland species that forms thickets from rhizomes.  Bladdernut likes rich, acidic soils.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May). This bare root tree is 2 years old and we trim to a height of approximately 12\".",
