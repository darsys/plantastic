  "description": "Slow to establish from seed, it's best to buy a few roots to get this great savanna/woodland plant naturalized.  Its large size allows it to fill in shade areas later in the summer when showy spring ephemerals have gone dormant.  The white candelabra-shaped flowers are fragrant, the attractive leaves are deep green, and the whole plant is generally deer/rabbit resistant.  Easy to maintain, Black Cohosh enjoys richer soils typical of woodlands but can tolerate periods of dryness. Also referred to as Bugbane or Black Snakeroot and Actea racemosa; the name Bugbane comes from the insect repellent smell the plant gives off.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
