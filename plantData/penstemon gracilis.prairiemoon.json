  "description": "The very pale violet flowers' 5 lobes, 2 on the top that tilt upward and 3 bottom lobes that turn down, create the classic Penstemon tubular flower that is a perfect invitation to bumble and other bees and pollinators. The Slender name comes from the leaves, which are toothed and more narrow than the common and widely-distributed Penstemon digitalis. A benefit of this pollinator-friendly plant is that it is drought tolerant.",
