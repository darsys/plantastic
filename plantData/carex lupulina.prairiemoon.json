Common Hop Sedge thrives in any sun exposure but prefers wet to medium-wet soils.  It reaches up to 3' in height with wide green leaf blades and spiked 'hop-looking' seed heads that form early summer.  Also useful in shoreline restorations, it can be placed on pond edges or lake shores.  Other names in use include simply, Hop Sedge.  Dormant bare root plants ship each year during optimal transplanting season: Fall (October) or Spring (April/May).",
