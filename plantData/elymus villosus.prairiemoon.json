  "description": "A common grass of deciduous woodlands.  The bristly, nodding inflorescence typical of Elymus species makes a nice accent in woodland gardens. Most Elymus grasses are short-lived perennials.  Silky Wild Rye actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.This seed is sold as PLS (Pure Live Seed). For example, if you order 1 lb and the PLS is 80%, you receive 1.25 lbs of bulk seed.",
