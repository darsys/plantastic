  "description": "Do not be fooled by the common name of Eriophorum angustifolium, Narrow-leaved Cotton Grass, because it is a member of the sedge family; technically, not a grass at all.  It’s from the fluffy, cotton-like flower and seed head that the very recognizable plant gets its name. Its stem and leaves are simple and green, with alternating attachment. This perennial is a characteristic species in nutrient-lacking wetlands. Narrow-leaved Cotton Grass thrives in and around marshes, bogs, stream banks and wet meadows in acidic soils.In the past, the airy, white seed fronds had a variety of uses, such as candle wicks, paper, pillow stuffing, and wound dressings but no usable thread has been derived from the seed-plumes because the fibers are too short and brittle. Narrow-leaved Cotton Grass is used in traditional Alaskan native cuisine and by the Yupik people for medicinal purposes.",
