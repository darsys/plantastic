  "description": "Leadplant (Amorpha canescens) exhibits a unique display of both foliage and flowers. Spikes of iridescent purple flowers extend above the delicate silver-gray foliage in the heat of midsummer. The deep taproot makes it extremely drought tolerant and able to thrive in any well-drained soil. An extremely long lived plant, Leadplant is one of the few true shrubs of the prairie. As a woody shrub, the plant will take a few years to become fully mature, during which time it should not be cut back.",
