  "description": "Dark-green Bulrush will form clumps from rhizomes and fibrous roots in the wettest of soils. We carry nearly 200 native species that tolerate saturated (oxygen-deficient) soils at least periodically but only a few will tolerate water depths of 1' or more like this Bulrush will.  It is a good choice for a lakeshore restoration, pond construction or rain garden.  It is a cool season grass meaning it actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.  Another name commonly used is simply Green Bulrush.",
